# <seo-module1-challenge>

## Description

 As a student that is new to the coding world, my motivation was to show everything that I had learned so far throughout the course. Doing so will prove that I am indeed learning which will give me more confidence leading into the next week, also serving as a small victory and milestone achievement!

I wanted to update the original starter code of the website, this includes making minute changes to HTML as well as CSS which would then meet the standard for accessibility and semantic structure.

The way the original HTML and CSS were written for the website was by no means wrong however the purpose was to give it a more updated/standard quality look rather than just the RAW text that was originally included throughout.

Throughout this course I have learned many things, some of which I cannot show just yet! However for this project I have learned new terminology,structure,semantics,consolidating, and how everything plays a role when tying together a website to make it go live. I have done best to show this with the updates included inside of the new and improved index's!
